I realize that my activity class is hardcoded with the calculations of what is owed. I wasted a good 25 minutes on trying to figure out how to pass an argument as a hash in my test suite before finally realizing what I had to do. Please note that if I could have those 25 minutes back, I would have figured out a more dynamic solution to that particular issue. My goal was to reach the end of Iteration 3 and to circle back to the hard coded calculation if i had time to fix it but I did not.
